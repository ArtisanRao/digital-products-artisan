          Since all our products are digital and delivered instantly after purchase, we generally do not offer refunds once a file has been downloaded.

        <p>
          However, if you encounter an issue with a file—such as corruption, download problems, or incorrect content—please contact us within 7 days of purchase. We will investigate and, if necessary, offer a replacement or refund at our discretion.

          To request assistance, please email our support team with your order number, a description of the issue, and any relevant screenshots or details.

          We want you to be satisfied with your purchase, and we stand by the quality of our digital goods. In rare cases where a product does not meet expectations, we will work with you to find a fair solution.

          Note: Refunds will not be granted for change-of-mind, accidental purchases, or failure to check product compatibility before buying.
